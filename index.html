      <h1 class="h1" style="text-align: left;">But here is my background!</h1>
      <p class="p">
        Since I graduated I was constantly looking for myself being in so many professions. When I was small fresh graduate I signed for Work&Travel program, applied for J1 visa and went to Alaska :) I love cold weather and wild nature. There, even though I lived a short american dream, working as a houseman and sushi maker, I had to return after 5 months. Later on I was working part jobs to support myself in university, like woodcarving and kebab making for my studentmates. When I finished university proud of myself I flew to United Kingdom in looking for better opportunities. Unfortuantely there I couldn't find something better than being a receptionist or working in a kitchen, giving away newspapers on the metro stations and serving guests on weddings. So I came back to Bulgaria where I started as a driver in the National Bulgarian Television. My responsbilities there were huge - the lives of my colleagues were in my hands on road. But since I was just temporary replacing a colleague in maternity, my contract ended. My employer wanted to keep me longer since he saw a reliable and valuable asset in me so I got hired as a sound engineer which was the closest to what I've been studying - movie directing. I was sooooo excited to start this! Had to learn a whole bunch of programs, technology, the feeling was like I'm part of a great production! I was going home energized and had power to start a hobby. I chose to learn a new language. Then I found Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS... But I was fascinated of making AI and work on cybersecurity so I chose Python. Since then I periodically stopped studying, started, stopped, moving back and forth with my knowledge. After I found the love of my live and moved to Poland, where I was working in H&M and Microsoft project from Accenture, eventually I decided to do something with my dream. Quit my job and started to study Python according to a Udemy course. The inflation was killing, the money were going low in my bank account but I never give up. Here I am, applying now, being confident about my future and what i want for the rest of my life - PYTHON programming!

      <h1 class="h1" style="text-align: right;">Maybe some educational background?</h1>
      <p class="p" style="text-align: right;">
        I finished highschool in Blagoevgrad's Humanitarian School where I was studying art - graphic drawing and woodcarving. But I'm not bad with colors too!
        Also I finished South West University in Bulgaria with profile "Movie and TV Directing". Ranked for the best documentary movie in whole Bulgaria once :)
